### stock-analysis

 ## Overview of Project
 In this project we created a workbook for Steve which he can use to analyze his dataset. Now we want to refactor the code and loop through all the data in order to collect the same information and compare the which VBA script runs faster.
 
 ## Analysis
 In our original workbook the execution time of the script for 2017 and 2018 were as follows:

After we refactored the code the execution time of the script for 2017 and 2018 were as follows:

## Results 

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
One of the advantages of refactoring code is that it shortens the code making it more easy to comprehend and maintain and in this project it helped to reduce the run time of the code meaning the refactored code was more efficient than the original one. 

One of the challenges I found when refactoring the code was that I came across some new errors in the code which I had to fix.
